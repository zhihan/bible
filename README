Use the following command to parse the input and insert verses.

    python3 add_verses.py msg_two.txt 1>msg_two_with_verses.txt

If you see ERROR logs, you need to look into the issues. Possible causes:

 - The input line has a different style, e.g., missing the '-' separator.
 - Bug in the code.

NOTE
The current limitation is that it does not understand the context. For example

In Ephesians chapter 4 .... (v. 14) ...

In the above example the code can only extract v. 14 but does not know it is
referring to Eph. 4:14. If you spot errors like this, the workaround is to
change the above line to the "standard" reference format.

In Ephesians chapter 4 .... (Eph. 4:14) ...
