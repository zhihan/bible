The Children of God Walking in Love and Light



Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:5, 9; 5:1-14; 1 John 4:8, 16; 1:5


Eph. 1:5  Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,
Eph. 1:9  Making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself,
Eph. 5:1  Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;
Eph. 5:2  And walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.
Eph. 5:3  But fornication and all uncleanness or greediness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints,
Eph. 5:4  And obscenity and foolish talking or sly, filthy jesting, which are not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks.
Eph. 5:5  For this you realize, knowing that every fornicator or unclean person or greedy person (who is an idolater) has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Eph. 5:6  Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.
Eph. 5:7  Therefore do not be partakers with them;
Eph. 5:8  For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light
Eph. 5:9  (For the fruit of the light [consists] in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
Eph. 5:10  Proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.
Eph. 5:11  And do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove [them.]
Eph. 5:12  For the things which are done by them in secret it is shameful even to speak of.
Eph. 5:13  But all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light; for everything that makes manifest is light.
Eph. 5:14  Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.
1 John 4:8  He who does not love has not known God, because God is love.
1 John 4:16  And we know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him.
1 John 1:5  And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.

I. God's good pleasure is to be one with man and to make man the same as He is in life and in nature but not in the God head-Eph. 1:5, 9.


Eph. 1:5  Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,
Eph. 1:9  Making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself,

II. As the children of God, we are God-men, born of God, possess- ing the life and nature of God, and belonging to the species of God-5:1; 1 John 3:1; John 1:12-13:


Eph. 5:1  Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;
1 John 3:1  Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are. Because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.
John 1:12  But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name,
John 1:13  Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

A. God is our real, genuine, Father, and we are His real, genuine, children-1 John 3:1; Eph. 5:1.


1 John 3:1  Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are. Because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.
Eph. 5:1  Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;

B. The greatest wonder in the universe is that human beings could be begotten of God and that sinners could be made children of God-1 John 3:1, 9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18; John 1:12-13.


1 John 3:1  Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are. Because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.
1 John 3:9  Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.
1 John 4:7  Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God.
1 John 5:1  Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God, and everyone who loves Him who has begotten loves him also who has been begotten of Him.
1 John 5:4  For everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which has overcome the world--our faith.
1 John 5:18  We know that everyone who is begotten of God does not sin, but he who has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him.
John 1:12  But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name,
John 1:13  Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

C. Through such an amazing divine birth we have received the divine life, the eternal life, as the divine seed sown into our being- 1 John 1:2; 3:9.


1 John 1:2  (And the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us);
1 John 3:9  Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.

D. Since we have been born of the divine life and possess the divine life, we, the children of God, are divine persons-5:11-13; 3:1, 10.


1 John 5:11  And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son.
1 John 5:12  He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.
1 John 5:13  I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.
1 John 3:1  Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are. Because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.
1 John 3:10  In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest. Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, neither he who does not love his brother.

E. As those who have been born of God, we have not only the divine life but also the divine nature-2 Pet. 1:4.


2 Pet. 1:4  Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.

F. Because we are the children of God with the life and nature of God, we can be imitators of God-Eph. 5:1.


Eph. 5:1  Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;

G. As the Father's children, having the Father's life and nature, we can be perfect as our Father is perfect-Matt. 5:48.


Matt. 5:48  You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.

III. We need to know and experience God as love and light- 1 John 4:8, 16; 1:5:


1 John 4:8  He who does not love has not known God, because God is love.
1 John 4:16  And we know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him.
1 John 1:5  And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.

A. Love and light are actually God Himself; they are God's being, His essence-4:8; 1:5.


1 John 4:8  He who does not love has not known God, because God is love.
1 John 1:5  And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.

B. First John says that God is light (v. 5) and then that God is love (4:8, 16).


1 John 1:5  And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
1 John 4:8  He who does not love has not known God, because God is love.
1 John 4:16  And we know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him.

C. Love, as the nature of God's essence, is the source of grace, and light, as the nature of God's expression, is the source of truth.



D. When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth.



IV. As children of God, we should walk in love and light-Eph. 5:2, 8:


Eph. 5:2  And walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.
Eph. 5:8  For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light

A. As grace and truth are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love and light are the basic elements of Paul's exhortation in 5:1-33:


Eph. 5:33  Nevertheless you also, each one of you, in the same way love your own wife as yourself; and the wife should fear her husband.

1. Grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace; truth is the revelation of light, and light is the origin of truth- 1 John 4:8; 1:5.


1 John 4:8  He who does not love has not known God, because God is love.
1 John 1:5  And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.

2. Love is the inner substance of God, and light is the expressed element of God; the inner love of God is sensible, and the outer light of God is visible.



3. Our daily walk as children of God should be constituted with both the loving substance of God and the shining element of God; this should be the inner source of our walk.



4. Walking in love and light is deeper and more tender than liv- ing according to truth and by grace.



B. "Walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor" Eph. 5:2:



1. To walk in love is to walk in intimacy with God-cf. 1 John 3:1:


1 John 3:1  Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are. Because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.

a. In the Father's presence, we not only enjoy grace, the ex- pression of love, but we also enjoy love itself.



b. In our daily walk we should always care for our Father's feeling, for we live intimately in His tender love.



2. The goal of the book of Ephesians is to bring us into love as the inner substance of God that we may enjoy His presence in the sweetness of the divine love and thereby love others as Christ did-Eph. 5:25:


Eph. 5:25  Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her

a. In the condition and atmosphere of love, we are saturated with God to be holy and without blemish before Him-1:4.


Eph. 1:4  Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love,

b. The love in which we are rooted for growth and grounded for building is the divine love realized and experienced by us in a practical way-3:17.


Eph. 3:17  That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love,

c. The love of Christ, which is Christ Himself, is immeasurable and knowledge-surpassing, yet we can know it by experi- encing it-v. 19.


Eph. 3:19  And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.

d. In the love of God in Christ, we hold to truth, that is, to Christ with His Body-4:15.


Eph. 4:15  But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ,

e. The Body of Christ builds itself up in love; love is the most excellent way for us to be anything and to do anything for the building up of the Body of Christ-v. 16; 1 Cor. 12:31.


Eph. 4:16  Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and [through] the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
1 Cor. 12:31  But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And moreover I show to you a most excellent way.

f. To love the Lord in incorruptibility means to love Him in the new creation and according to all the incorruptible things revealed in the book of Ephesians-Eph. 6:24.


Eph. 6:24  Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility.

3. As those who have been regenerated to become God's species, As the children of God, should be love because God is love: since we become God in life and in nature, we also should be. come love-1 John 4:8, 16.


1 John 4:8  He who does not love has not known God, because God is love.
1 John 4:16  And we know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him.

C. "You were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light"-Eph. 5:8:


Eph. 5:8  For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light

1. As God is light, so we, the children of God, are children of light-1 John 1:5; Eph. 5:8; John 12:36.


1 John 1:5  And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
Eph. 5:8  For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light
John 12:36  While you have the light, believe into the light, so that you may become sons of light. Jesus said these things, and He went away and was hidden from them.

2. We are not only children of light we are light itself; we are light because we are one with God in the Lord-Matt. 5:14; 1 John 1:5.


Matt. 5:14  You are the light of the world. It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden.
1 John 1:5  And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.

3. When we are in the light, we are outside the realm of right and wrong-v. 7.


1 John 1:7  But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.

4. If we walk as children of light, we will bear the fruit described in Ephesians 5:9:



a. The fruit of the light must be good in nature, righteous in procedure, and real in expression, that God may be expressed as the reality of our daily walk.



b. The fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the Triune God:



1) God the Father as goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light; therefore, goodness in verse 9 refers to God the Father-Matt. 19:17.


Matt. 19:17  And He said to him, Why do you ask Me concerning what is good? There is [only] One [who is] good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.

2) Righteousness refers to God the Son, for Christ came to accomplish God's purpose according to God's right- eous procedure-Rom. 5:17-18, 21.


Rom. 5:17  For if, by the offense of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.
Rom. 5:18  So then as [it was] through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also [it was] through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men.
Rom. 5:21  In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

3) Truth, the expression of the fruit of the light, refers to God the Spirit, for He is the Spirit of reality-John 14:17; 16:13.


John 14:17  [Even] the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know [Him; but] you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
John 16:13  But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.

C. The proof that we are walking in the bearing of such fruit. as children of light is is seen in the bearing of such fruit.
