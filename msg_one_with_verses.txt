The Seed of David Becoming the Son of God



Scripture Reading: Acts 13:23, 33; Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29


Acts 13:23  From this man's seed, God, according to promise, brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,
Acts 13:33  That God has fully fulfilled this [promise] to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You."
Rom. 1:3  Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,
Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;
Rom. 8:29  Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;

I. In Acts 13 Paul said that from David's seed "God, according to promise, brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus" (v. 23), and that "God has fully fulfilled this promise...in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, 'You are My Son; this day have I begotten You" (v. 33):



A. In verses 32 and 33 we see that Christ as the Firstborn of God was promised to the fathers, and God fulfilled this promise by raising up Jesus.



B. Resurrection was a birth to the man Jesus:



1. He was begotten by God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers-Rom. 8:29.


Rom. 8:29  Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;

2. He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity-John 1:18; 3:16.


John 1:18  No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared [Him.]
John 3:16  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.

3. After His incarnation, through resurrection He was begotten by God in His humanity to be God's firstborn Son-Heb. 1:6.


Heb. 1:6  And when He brings again the Firstborn into the inhabited earth, He says, "And let all the angels of God worship Him."

C. Paul was able to see the Lord's resurrection in Psalm 2:7: "You are My Son; /Today I have begotten You":



1. Paul applied the word today to the day of the Lord's resur- rection.



2. This means that Christ's resurrection was His birth as the firstborn Son of God.



3. Jesus, the Son of Man, was born to be the Son of God through being raised up from the dead; therefore, God's raising up Jesus from the dead was His begetting of Him to be His first- born Son-Acts 13:33.


Acts 13:33  That God has fully fulfilled this [promise] to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You."

D. Through incarnation God's only begotten Son put on humanity and became the God-man (John 1:14, 18; Luke 1:35); then in res- urrection this God-man was born of God to be His Firstborn (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:6; Rom. 8:29):



1. Before incarnation God's only begotten Son did not have the human nature; He had only the divine nature.



2. In resurrection God's firstborn Son has the human nature as well as the divine nature.



E. Through His resurrection Christ was born to be the firstborn Son, and at the same time all His believers were born to be the many sons of God-1 Pet. 1:3; Heb. 2:10:


1 Pet. 1:3  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
Heb. 2:10  For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.

1. Among these many sons, only the Firstborn is God's only be- gotten Son-John 1:18; 1 John 4:9.


John 1:18  No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared [Him.]
1 John 4:9  In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.

2. This only begotten Son of God, in His resurrected humanity, is also the firstborn Son of God-Rom. 8:29.


Rom. 8:29  Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;

3. The Firstborn has both divinity and humanity, and we, His believers as God's many sons, also possess both the human nature and the divine nature-2 Pet. 1:4.


2 Pet. 1:4  Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.

II. We need to know Christ in His resurrection designated as the Son of God in power with His human nature-Rom. 1:3-4:


Rom. 1:3  Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,
Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;

A. Before His incarnation and resurrection, Christ was the Son of God, the only begotten Son John 1:18; 3:16.



B. Although Christ already was the Son of God before the incarna- tion, He still needed to be designated the Son of God out of resur- rection because by incarnation He had put on the human nature, which had nothing to do with divinity-1:1, 14; Rom. 8:3:


Rom. 1:1  Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
Rom. 1:14  I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish;
Rom. 8:3  For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,

1. After the Son of God became incarnate, His divine nature was concealed by the flesh.



2. Christ was already the Son of God in His divinity, but the part of Him that was Jesus with the human nature, born of Mary. was not the Son of God-Luke 1:31-32, 35.


Luke 1:31  And behold, you will conceive in [your] womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus.
Luke 1:32  He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father,
Luke 1:35  And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God.

3. By His resurrection Christ sanctified and uplifted His human nature, His humanity, and He was designated out of resurrec- tion as the Son of God with this human nature; in this sense He was begotten the Son of God in His resurrection-Rom. 1:3-4; Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5.


Rom. 1:3  Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,
Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;
Acts 13:33  That God has fully fulfilled this [promise] to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You."
Heb. 1:5  For to which of the angels has He ever said, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You"? And again, "I will be a Father to Him, and He will be a Son to Me"?

4. This designation of the Son of God was "in power," the power of Christ's resurrection, the reality of which is the Spirit- Rom. 1:4; Phil. 3:10; Eph. 1:19-20.


Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;
Phil. 3:10  To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,
Eph. 1:19  And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength,
Eph. 1:20  Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies,

C. Through designation in resurrection the Christ who was already the Son of God before His incarnation became the Son of God in a new way-Rom. 1:4:


Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;

1. Before His incarnation He was the Son of God only with divin- ity, through His resurrection He was designated the Son of God with both divinity and humanity-v. 4.


Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;

2. If Christ had not put on human nature, there would have been no need for Him to be designated the Son of God, for in His divinity He was already the Son of God, even from eternity- John 1:18; 17:5.


John 1:18  No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared [Him.]
John 17:5  And now, glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.

3. Having put on humanity through incarnation, He was designated the Son of God with humanity in resurrection-1:14; Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4; Heb. 2:14:


John 1:14  And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.
Rom. 8:3  For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,
Rom. 1:3  Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,
Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;
Heb. 2:14  Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil,

a. As the designated Son of God, Christ has two natures, divinity and humanity, the humanity that He now has is not a natural humanity but a humanity uplifted in resur rection-Rom. 1:4.


Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;

b. Even Christ's human nature has been designated the Son of God, for He has been designated the Son of God with both divinity and humanity.



D. The designation of Christ as the Son of God with humanity was "according to the Spirit of holiness-v. 4:


Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;

1. The Spirit of holiness is the life essence within the Lord Jesus; when He lived on earth in the flesh, He had this essence within Him-Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35.


Matt. 1:18  Now the origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, after she had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.
Matt. 1:20  But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.
Luke 1:35  And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God.

2. When the Lord Jesus was resurrected from among the dead, He was designated the Son of God in power by resurrection according to the Spirit of holiness that was in Him-Rom. 1:4.


Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;

3. Now He is the Son of God in a way that is more wonderful than before, for now He has both the divine nature and the resur rected, transformed, uplifted, glorified, and designated human nature-6:4; Luke 24:26; John 17:5; Acts 3:13.


Rom. 6:4  We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life.
Luke 24:26  Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?
John 17:5  And now, glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.
Acts 3:13  The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release [Him.]

E. We need to connect Romans 1:3-4 and 8:29:



1. Through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ, the Son of God, became the firstborn Son, and the many sons, who are the brothers of Christ, are being conformed to His image-Heb. 2:10-11; Rom. 8:29.


Heb. 2:10  For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
Heb. 2:11  For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers,
Rom. 8:29  Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;

2. In Romans 1:3-4 Christ, the Son of God, is the prototype, whereas in 8:29 the many brothers are those who have been "mass-produced" from the prototype and, by being saved in life, will be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son



3. This brings us to the matter of deification and implies that God's intention in His economy is to make Himself man so that, in Christ, we, the believers in Christ and children of God, may become God in life, in nature, and in constitution (but not in the Godhead); such an implication is exceedingly great, and eventually, the Bible consummates with this matter-Rom. 8:29; 1:3-4; John 1:1-13; 1 John 3:1; Rev. 21:2, 10-11.


Rom. 8:29  Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;
Rom. 1:3  Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,
Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;
John 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
John 1:2  He was in the beginning with God.
John 1:3  All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.
John 1:4  In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
John 1:5  And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.
John 1:6  There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.
John 1:7  He came for a testimony that he might testify concerning the light, that all might believe through him.
John 1:8  He was not the light, but [came] that he might testify concerning the light.
John 1:9  [This] was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.
John 1:10  He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, yet the world did not know Him.
John 1:11  He came to His own, yet those who were His own did not receive Him.
John 1:12  But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name,
John 1:13  Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
1 John 3:1  Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are. Because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.
Rev. 21:2  And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
Rev. 21:10  And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
Rev. 21:11  Having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.
