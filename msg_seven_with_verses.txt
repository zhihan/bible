The One Who Is Formed in the Believers



Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:15-16; 2:20; 3:29; 4:5, 19; Eph. 3:17a; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29; 12:2a


Gal. 1:15  But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me through His grace,
Gal. 1:16  To reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,
Gal. 2:20  I am crucified with Christ; and [it is] no longer I [who] live, but [it is] Christ [who] lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
Gal. 3:29  And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.
Gal. 4:5  That He might redeem those under law that we might receive the sonship.
Gal. 4:19  My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you,
Eph. 3:17  That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
2 Cor. 3:18  But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
Rom. 8:29  Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;
Rom. 12:2  And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.

I. The New Testament reveals that Christ is deeply related to our inner being and desires to have a subjective relationship with us-Gal. 1:15-16; 2:20:


Gal. 1:15  But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me through His grace,
Gal. 1:16  To reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,
Gal. 2:20  I am crucified with Christ; and [it is] no longer I [who] live, but [it is] Christ [who] lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.

A. God revealed His Son to Paul and to us-1:15-16:


Gal. 1:15  But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me through His grace,
Gal. 1:16  To reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,

1. The word reveal in Galatians 1:16 is crucial and of utmost importance.



2. To reveal is to make known (divulge) or to show plainly (dis- play) something that has been kept secret.



3. In the New Testament revealed is used in a profound manner related to our spirit-Rom. 1:17; 8:18; 1 Cor. 2:10; 1 Pet. 1:5; 5:1.


Rom. 1:17  For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith, as it is written, "But the righteous shall have life and live by faith."
Rom. 8:18  For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed upon us.
1 Cor. 2:10  But to us God has revealed [them] through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.
1 Pet. 1:5  Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed at the last time;
1 Pet. 5:1  Therefore the elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory to be revealed:

4. God's revealing of His Son to us is in us; it is not outward but inward, not by an outward vision but an inward seeing.



5. God's heart's desire is to reveal His Son in us so that we may know Him, receive Him as our life (John 17:3; 3:16), and be- come sons of God (1:12; Gal. 4:5-6).



B. In Galatians 2:20 we see the most basic truth of God's economy- no longer I but Christ living in me:



1. When Christ was crucified according to God's economy, we were included in Him; this is an accomplished fact-Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; 6:14.


Rom. 6:6  Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with [Him] in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves;
Gal. 2:20  I am crucified with Christ; and [it is] no longer I [who] live, but [it is] Christ [who] lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
Gal. 6:14  But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.

2. We have died to the law and live to God through the organic union with Christ John 15:4-5; 1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 12:4-5; 1 Thes. 1:1.


Gal. 6:5  For each one shall bear his own load.
1 Cor. 6:17  But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
Rom. 12:4  For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function,
Rom. 12:5  So we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
1 Thes. 1:1  Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.

3. The "I" in Galatians 2:20 refers not only to Paul but to each one of us, and Paul's testimony is also our testimony:



a. "I am crucified with Christ" -Gal. 2:20a.


Gal. 2:20  I am crucified with Christ; and [it is] no longer I [who] live, but [it is] Christ [who] lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.

b. "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me"-v. 20b.


Gal. 2:20  I am crucified with Christ; and [it is] no longer I [who] live, but [it is] Christ [who] lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.

c. "The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God"-v. 20—Å.



d. "The Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me" v. 20d.



e. "What from Thee can separate me?/ Thou wilt love me to the end!/Oh! Thy love is so prevailing, /E'en Thyself with me to blend!/We two one will be forever; / I am Thine and Thou art mine!/This will be my testimony: / In Thy love we'll ever twine!" Hymns, #152, stanza 4.



II. Christ was crucified (Gal. 3:1) to redeem us out of the curse of the law (v. 13) and rescue us out of the evil religious course of the world (1:4), and He was resurrected from the dead so that He might live in us (2:20) and be formed in us at our maturity (4:19).


Gal. 3:1  O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified?
Gal. 3:13  Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, "Cursed is everyone hanging on a tree";
Gal. 1:4  Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father,
Gal. 2:20  I am crucified with Christ; and [it is] no longer I [who] live, but [it is] Christ [who] lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
Gal. 4:19  My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you,

III. In Galatians 4:19 Christ is presented as the One who is formed in the believers:



A. Christ, a living person, is the focus of Paul's gospel-1:16; Rom. 1:1, 3-4.


Gal. 1:16  To reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,
Rom. 1:1  Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
Rom. 1:3  Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,
Rom. 1:4  Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;

B. Paul's preaching was to bring forth Christ, the Son of the living God, in the believers-Gal. 1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19.


Gal. 1:15  But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me through His grace,
Gal. 1:16  To reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,
Gal. 2:20  I am crucified with Christ; and [it is] no longer I [who] live, but [it is] Christ [who] lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
Gal. 4:19  My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you,

C. Christ is now living in us, and He will be formed in us-v. 19.


Gal. 4:19  My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you,

D. Paul was travailing so that Christ might be formed in the believ- ers for their full sonship-vv. 5, 19.


Gal. 4:5  That He might redeem those under law that we might receive the sonship.
Gal. 4:19  My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you,

IV. According to Paul's usage in the New Testament, the word form refers to the outward expression of the inner being (Phil. 2:6); what we are is expressed in our form, that is, the outward expression of our inner being.


Phil. 2:6  Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped,

V. To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ fully grown in us-Gal. 4:19; Eph. 4:13-16:


Gal. 4:19  My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you,
Eph. 4:13  Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,
Eph. 4:14  That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error,
Eph. 4:15  But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ,
Eph. 4:16  Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and [through] the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.

A. First, Christ was born into us at the time we repented and be- lieved into Him, then He lives in us in our Christian life (Gal. 2:20), and finally, He will be formed in us at our maturity.


Gal. 2:20  I am crucified with Christ; and [it is] no longer I [who] live, but [it is] Christ [who] lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.

B. To have Christ formed in us is to allow Him to permeate our whole being and saturate our inward parts-4:19; Eph. 3:17a; Col. 3:4, 10-11:


Gal. 4:19  My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you,
Eph. 3:17  That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
Col. 3:4  When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.
Col. 3:10  And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him,
Col. 3:11  Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.

1. When Christ occupies our inner being in this way, He is formed in us Psa. 51:6.



2. We need to allow Christ to saturate every part of our inner being; He must occupy us and saturate our mind, emotion, and will-Phil. 2:5; Eph. 3:17a.


Phil. 2:5  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,
Eph. 3:17  That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love,

3. To have Christ possess our entire being is to have Him formed in us-Gal. 4:19.


Gal. 4:19  My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you,

C. For Christ to make His home in our hearts, He needs to be able to settle down within us, and this requires that we allow Christ to make His home in all the parts of our inner being; this is to have Christ formed in us-Eph. 3:17a.


Eph. 3:17  That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love,

D. To have Christ formed in us is to allow the all-inclusive Spirit to occupy every part of our inner being-Gal. 4:19; 3:2-3, 14; to



1. Christ should not only spread into our mind, emotion, and will; He should actually become our mind, emotion, and will Phil. 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:16.



2. Everything other than Christ must diminish, and Christ must become everything to us in our experience; this is to have Christ formed in us.



E. To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ mingled with our whole being-6:17:


Eph. 6:17  And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which [Spirit] is the word of God,

1. In every part of our being, Christ should be mingled with us- Eph. 4:23.


Eph. 4:23  And [that] you be renewed in the spirit of your mind

2. Christ must permeate us and saturate us until He is com- pletely blended with us; then He will be formed in us-3:17a; Gal. 4:19.


Eph. 3:17  That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
Gal. 4:19  My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you,

F. Paul's word about Christ being formed in the believers implies that we are being constituted with Christ-Col. 1:27; 3:4, 10-11:


Col. 1:27  To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory,
Col. 3:4  When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.
Col. 3:10  And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him,
Col. 3:11  Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.

1. Christ is living in us, He is being formed in us, and He is becoming our constitution; Christ is now living in us so that we may be constituted with Him organically-Gal. 2:20; Col. 3:4, 10-11.


Gal. 2:20  I am crucified with Christ; and [it is] no longer I [who] live, but [it is] Christ [who] lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
Col. 3:4  When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.
Col. 3:10  And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him,
Col. 3:11  Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.

2. Eventually, our whole being will be constituted with the ele- ment of Christ, for He will constitute every part of our soul so that we may have His form, His image, in every part of our being-2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29.


2 Cor. 3:18  But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
Rom. 8:29  Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;

G. The word formed in Galatians 4:19 corresponds to the word image in 2 Corinthians 3:18:



1. Christ with His element is working within us organically so that we may have His form and express His image-Rom. 8:29.


Rom. 8:29  Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;

2. Christ's being formed in us depends on our being transformed into His image-2 Cor. 3:18.


2 Cor. 3:18  But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.

3. Our being transformed into His image and His being formed in us cause us to be conformed to His image; our being con- formed to His image is the issue of His being formed in us-



Gal. 4:19; Rom. 8:29. H. To have Christ formed in us is to have the three parts of our soul- our mind, emotion, and will-renewed-12:2a; Eph. 4:23:


2 Cor. 12:2  I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know; God knows) such a one was caught away to the third heaven.
Eph. 4:23  And [that] you be renewed in the spirit of your mind

1. In order for our mind, emotion, and will to be renewed, Christ must saturate our mind, emotion, and will and replace the self and the world in our soul with Himself-Rom. 12:2a.


Rom. 12:2  And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.

2. If we are renewed in this way, every part of our inner being will bear the image of Christ-2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29.


2 Cor. 3:18  But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
Rom. 8:29  Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;

VI. Christ needs to be formed in us so that we may be sons of full age and heirs to inherit God's promised blessing and so that we may mature in the divine sonship-Gal. 3:14, 26, 29; 4:5-6:


Gal. 3:14  In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Gal. 3:26  For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Gal. 3:29  And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.
Gal. 4:5  That He might redeem those under law that we might receive the sonship.
Gal. 4:6  And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!

A. Galatians 3:26 says, "You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus"; the expression sons of God refers to sons of full age.



B. Under the old testament, God's chosen people were considered infants; now under the new testament, they are considered sons of full age, who will inherit the promised blessing-the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ.



C. Christ must mature in us in order for us to be heirs for the full enjoyment of the Triune God as our inheritance; the Holy Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance-Eph. 1:13b-14; 1 Pet. 1:4.


Eph. 1:13  In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise,
1 Pet. 1:4  Unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you,

D. We need to pray that the Lord will bring us into the experience and enjoyment of Christ, who has been born into us, is now living in us, and will be formed in us at our maturity in order that we may be sons of full age and heirs of God's promised blessing and that we may mature in the divine sonship-Gal. 3:29; 4:6, 19.


Gal. 3:29  And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.
Gal. 4:6  And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!
Gal. 4:19  My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you,
