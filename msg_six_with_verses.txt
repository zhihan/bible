The Grace of God and the All-inclusive Spirit



Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 1:12, 15, 21-22; 3:3, 6, 8, 17-18; 12:9; 13:14


1 Cor. 15:10  But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.
2 Cor. 1:12  For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
2 Cor. 1:15  And in this confidence I intended to come to you previously that you might have double grace,
2 Cor. 1:21  But the One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God,
2 Cor. 1:22  He who has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.
2 Cor. 3:3  Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.
2 Cor. 3:6  Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, [ministers] not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
2 Cor. 3:8  How shall the ministry of the Spirit not be more in glory?
2 Cor. 3:17  And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
2 Cor. 3:18  But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
2 Cor. 12:9  And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.
2 Cor. 13:14  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

I. In 2 Corinthians Christ as the grace of God is the good land for us to enter into, experience, enjoy, partake of, and pos- sess-John 1:17; 1 Cor. 15:10; cf. Gal. 2:20; 1 Cor. 5:7; 10:3-4; 2 Cor. 13:14:


John 1:17  For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.
1 Cor. 15:10  But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.
Gal. 2:20  I am crucified with Christ; and [it is] no longer I [who] live, but [it is] Christ [who] lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
1 Cor. 5:7  Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.
1 Cor. 10:3  And all ate the same spiritual food,
1 Cor. 10:4  And all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed [them,] and the rock was Christ.
2 Cor. 13:14  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

A. In 2 Corinthians 13:14 the grace of the Lord is mentioned first because this book is on the grace of Christ-1:12; 4:15; 6:1; 8:1, 9; 9:8, 14; 12:9:


2 Cor. 1:12  For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
2 Cor. 4:15  For all things are for your sakes that the grace which has abounded through the greater number may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.
2 Cor. 6:1  And working together with [Him,] we also entreat you not to receive the grace of God in vain;
2 Cor. 8:1  Furthermore we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,
2 Cor. 8:9  For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor in order that you, because of His poverty, might become rich.
2 Cor. 9:8  And God is able to make all grace abound unto you, that, in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound unto every good work;
2 Cor. 9:14  While in petition on your behalf they also long after you on account of the surpassing grace of God upon you.
2 Cor. 12:9  And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.

1. The Holy Spirit as the circulation, the transmission, of the grace of Christ with the love of the Father is the supply in our Christian life and church life:



a. The entire church life depends upon 2 Corinthians 13:14.



b. The current of the Divine Trinity within us as revealed in 2 Corinthians 13:14 is our spiritual pulse.



2. The blessing in 2 Corinthians 13:14 is the same as that in Numbers 6:22-27; this is the eternal blessing of the Triune God, which is the Triune God dispensing Himself in His Divine Trinity into us for our enjoyment:



a. "Jehovah bless you and keep you" is the love of God the Father as the fountain of life and light-Num. 6:24; Psa. 36:9.


Num. 6:24  Jehovah bless you and keep you;
Psa. 36:9  For with You is the fountain of life; / In Your light we see light.

b. "Jehovah make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you" is the grace of Christ as the fatness of God's house- Num. 6:25; Psa. 36:8.


Num. 6:25  Jehovah make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you;
Psa. 36:8  They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures.

c. "Jehovah lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace" is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit as the river of God's pleasures-Num. 6:26; Psa. 36:8.


Num. 6:26  Jehovah lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace.
Psa. 36:8  They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures.

B. The grace of God in His economy is rich, multiplying, and abound- ing-Eph. 2:7; 1 Pet. 1:2b; 2 Pet. 1:2; Eph. 1:7b-8:


Eph. 2:7  That He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
1 Pet. 1:2  Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
2 Pet. 1:2  Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;
Eph. 1:7  In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace,

1. God has graced us in the Beloved-v. 6.


Eph. 1:6  To the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved;

2. We have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand-Rom. 5:2a.


Rom. 5:2  Through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God.

3. When Christ in us is daily received, experienced, and enjoyed by us, that is grace being added to us, grace upon grace-John 1:16.


John 1:16  For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.

C. The new covenant ministers' living is the living of grace, the ex- perience of grace-Heb. 12:28; 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 1:12, 15:


Heb. 12:28  Therefore receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly with piety and fear;
1 Cor. 15:10  But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.
2 Cor. 1:12  For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
2 Cor. 1:15  And in this confidence I intended to come to you previously that you might have double grace,

1. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Spirit of grace, is with our spirit, which has been regenerated to be the dwelling place and vessel of the Triune God-Heb. 10:29b; Gal. 6:18; Phil. 4:23; Philem. 25; 2 Tim. 4:22; cf. 1:6-7.


Heb. 10:29  By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
Gal. 6:18  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
Phil. 4:23  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Philem. 4:25  No such chapter in Philem.
2 Tim. 4:22  The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
2 Tim. 1:6  For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
2 Tim. 1:7  For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.

2. Whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter through the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ as the heavenly ladder-Heb. 4:16; Gen. 28:12-17; John 1:51; Eph. 2:22.


Heb. 4:16  Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.
Gen. 28:12  And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
Gen. 28:13  And there was Jehovah, standing above it; and He said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, I will give to you and to your seed.
Gen. 28:14  And your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.
Gen. 28:15  And, behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will cause you to return to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.
Gen. 28:16  And Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know [it.]
Gen. 28:17  And he was afraid and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
John 1:51  And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.
Eph. 2:22  In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.

3. Grace is with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility-6:24.


Eph. 6:24  Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility.

4. Humility saves us from all kinds of destruction and invites God's grace-1 Pet. 5:5-6; James 4:6.


1 Pet. 5:5  In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.
1 Pet. 5:6  Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time,
James 4:6  But He gives greater grace; therefore it says, "God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble."

5. We need to enjoy the word of His grace-Acts 20:32; Jer. 15:16.


Acts 20:32  And now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build [you] up and to give [you] the inheritance among all those who have been sanctified.
Jer. 15:16  Your words were found and I ate them, / And Your word became to me / The gladness and joy of my heart, / For I am called by Your name, / O Jehovah, God of hosts.

6. We need to experience the Spirit of grace and of supplications to bring us into the enjoyment of the Triune God-Zech. 12:10a.


Zech. 12:10  And I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplications; and they will look upon Me, whom they have pierced; and they will wail over Him with wailing as for an only son and cry bitterly over Him with bitter crying as for a firstborn son.

7. The new covenant ministers enjoy Christ as their all-sufficient grace through sufferings:



a. The ministry of the new covenant is produced by revelation plus suffering-2 Cor. 12:7; 1:3-4, 8-10.


2 Cor. 12:7  And because of the transcendence of the revelations, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up.
2 Cor. 1:3  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all comfort,
2 Cor. 1:4  Who comforts us in all our affliction that we may be able to comfort those who are in every affliction through the comforting with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
2 Cor. 1:8  For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell [us] in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond [our] power, so that we despaired even of living.
2 Cor. 1:9  Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead;
2 Cor. 1:10  Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver [us;] in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver [us,]

b. Christ as grace becomes power tabernacling over the new covenant ministers, overshadowing them in their weak- ness to become their dwelling place to sustain, support, maintain, protect, and keep them-12:9b.


2 Cor. 12:9  And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.

8. We need the grace of God in Christ applied to us as the strength and power for our move and our protection-Ezek. 1:6b, 9a; Exo. 19:4; Isa. 40:31; 2 Cor. 4:7; 1:12; 12:9; 1 Cor. 15:10; Psa. 17:8; 57:1; 63:7; 91:4.


Ezek. 1:6  And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.
Ezek. 1:9  Their wings were joined one to another; they did not turn as they went; each went straight forward.
Exo. 19:4  You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and [how] I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself.
Isa. 40:31  Yet those who wait on Jehovah will renew [their] strength; / They will mount up with wings like eagles; / They will run and will not become weary; / They will walk and will not faint.
2 Cor. 4:7  But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.
2 Cor. 1:12  For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
2 Cor. 12:9  And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.
1 Cor. 15:10  But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.
Psa. 17:8  Guard me like the pupil of [Your] eye; / In the shadow of Your wings hide me
Psa. 57:1  Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me; / For my soul takes refuge in You; / Indeed in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge, / Until the destruction passes by.
Psa. 63:7  For You have been my help, / And in the shadow of Your wings I will shout for joy.
Psa. 91:4  With His pinions He will cover You, / And under His wings You will take refuge; / His truth is a shield and a buckler.

9. We reign in life by receiving the abundance of grace-Rom. 5:17.


Rom. 5:17  For if, by the offense of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.

10. We need to be good stewards of the varied grace of God-1 Pet. 4:10; Eph. 3:2.


1 Pet. 4:10  Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.
Eph. 3:2  If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you,

11. Our word should convey grace to the hearers-Luke 4:22; Eph. 4:29; Isa. 50:4.


Luke 4:22  And all bore witness to Him and marveled at the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth, and they said, Is not this Joseph's son?
Eph. 4:29  Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear.
Isa. 50:4  The Lord Jehovah has given me / The tongue of the instructed, / That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word. / He awakens [me] morning by morning; / He awakens my ear / To hear as an instructed one.

12. We need to enjoy the grace of life in the church life to keep ourselves in the genuine oneness-Psa. 133.


Psa. 50:133  No such verse in Psa. 50

13. In the church life, when we have grace upon us, the church will be built up, and the grace that we receive will be visible-Acts 4:33; 11:23.


Acts 4:33  And with great power the apostles gave testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
Acts 11:23  Who, when he arrived and saw the grace of God, rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain with the Lord with purpose of heart;

14. The product of the grace in God's economy is the Body of Christ as the poem of God, expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design-Eph. 2:10, 7; 2 Cor. 5:17.


Eph. 2:10  For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them.
Eph. 2:7  That He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
2 Cor. 5:17  So then if anyone is in Christ, [he is] a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.

15. The grace of the Lord Jesus dispensed to His believers through- out the new testament age consummates in the New Jerusa- lem, in which the processed and consummated Triune God will be the grace enjoyed by all the believers for eternity- Rev. 22:21; cf. 21:23; 22:1-2.


Rev. 22:21  The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.
Rev. 21:23  And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
Rev. 22:1  And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.
Rev. 22:2  And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

II. In order to be constituted as the ministers of the new cove- nant for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need to experience all the aspects of Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit in 2 Corinthians:



A. The anointing Spirit is the indwelling, compound Spirit moving and working within us to impart all of God's divine ingredients and constituents into us-2 Cor. 1:21; Phil. 1:19; Exo. 30:23-25; Rom. 10:12-13:


2 Cor. 1:21  But the One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God,
Phil. 1:19  For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and [the] bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
Exo. 30:23  You also take the finest spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred [shekels,] and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, two hundred fifty [shekels,] and of fragrant calamus two hundred fifty [shekels,]
Exo. 30:24  And of cassia five hundred [shekels,] according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil.
Exo. 30:25  And you shall make it a holy anointing oil, a fragrant ointment compounded according to the work of a compounder; it shall be a holy anointing oil.
Rom. 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord [is] [Lord] of all [and] rich to all who call upon Him;
Rom. 10:13  For "whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."

1. The reaching of the anointing accomplishes the central pur- pose of God's salvation to anoint the compounded God into us so that we may be united, mingled, and incorporated with Him-1 Cor. 15:45b; 1 John 2:20, 27.


1 Cor. 15:45  So also it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living soul"; the last Adam [became] a life-giving Spirit.
1 John 2:20  And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know.
1 John 2:27  And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.

2. The teaching of the anointing is the inward feeling generated by the moving of the Spirit within us, enabling us to know God's mind and to live in Him, teaching us the things concern- ing the Triune God and His activities-v. 27; Acts 16:6-7.


1 John 2:27  And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.
Acts 16:6  And they passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
Acts 16:7  And when they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.

B. The sealing Spirit forms the divine elements into an impression to express God's image-2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:13:


2 Cor. 1:22  He who has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.
Eph. 1:13  In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise,

1. The sealing Spirit saturates the believers continuously unto the redemption of their body-4:30.


Eph. 4:30  And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.

2. The sealing Spirit transforms the believers into a treasure to God as His inheritance-1:11.


Eph. 1:11  In whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will,

3. The more we are sealed, the more we bear the image of God to be constituted into the masterpiece of God-2 Cor. 3:18b; Eph. 2:10.


2 Cor. 3:18  But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
Eph. 2:10  For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them.

C. The pledging Spirit gives us a foretaste as a sample and guar- antee of the full taste of God-2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5:


2 Cor. 1:22  He who has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.
2 Cor. 5:5  Now He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the Spirit as a pledge.

1. The Spirit's pledging guarantees that God is our inheritance- Eph. 1:14.


Eph. 1:14  Who is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory.

2. Christ as the pledging Spirit is in us for our taste, for our enjoyment of Him as our divine inheritance, our allotted por- tion, through the exercise of our spirit-Psa. 34:8; 1 Pet. 2:3; Col. 1:12.


Psa. 34:8  Taste and see that Jehovah is good; / Blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him.
1 Pet. 2:3  If you have tasted that the Lord is good.
Col. 1:12  Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light;

D. The inscribing Spirit writes Christ into us to make us the living letters of Christ-2 Cor. 3:3; cf. Psa. 45:1:


2 Cor. 3:3  Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.
Psa. 45:1  My heart overflows with a good matter; / I speak what I have composed concerning the King. / My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

1. Christ is being inscribed into us with the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God; if we are under the Spirit's inscrib- ing, we have the deep sensation of being living within.



2. The Spirit is the ink, and the content of the ink is Christ with His person, work, and attainments; the compound Spirit as the compound ink adds the substance of Christ into us and saturates us with the essence of Christ.



E. The life-giving Spirit, the vivifying Spirit, imparts the divine life into our being to make us men of life with the ministry of life- 2 Cor. 3:6, 17; John 7:38:


2 Cor. 3:6  Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, [ministers] not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
2 Cor. 3:17  And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
John 7:38  He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.

1. When we study and read the Bible prayerfully with the exer- cise of our spirit, we are vivified-2 Cor. 3:6; John 6:63.


2 Cor. 3:6  Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, [ministers] not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
John 6:63  It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.

2. To be one who can give life to others, we must abide in the divine life and must walk, live, and have our being in the divine life-1 John 5:16a.


1 John 5:16  If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask and he will give life to him, to those sinning not unto death. There is a sin unto death; I do not say that he should make request concerning that.

F. The ministering Spirit imparts all that Christ is into us and makes all that Christ is and has real to us-2 Cor. 3:8; John 16:13-15:


2 Cor. 3:8  How shall the ministry of the Spirit not be more in glory?
John 16:13  But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.
John 16:14  He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare [it] to you.
John 16:15  All that the Father has is Mine; for this [reason] I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare [it] to you.

1. We can receive the supply of the ministering Spirit by exer- cising our spirit to pray and call on the Lord-Gal. 3:5a; Col. 4:2; Rom. 10:12-13.


Gal. 3:5  He therefore who bountifully supplies to you the Spirit and does works of power among you, [does He do it] out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith?
Col. 4:2  Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving,
Rom. 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord [is] [Lord] of all [and] rich to all who call upon Him;
Rom. 10:13  For "whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."

2. The ministering Spirit ministers Christ into us and ministers Christ to others through us-2 Cor. 3:6; cf. Phil. 1:25.


2 Cor. 3:6  Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, [ministers] not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
Phil. 1:25  And being confident of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of the faith,

G. The freeing Spirit frees us from the bondage of the letter of the law; the Spirit of the Lord is the Lord Himself, with whom is freedom-2 Cor. 3:17; 4:5; Gal. 2:4; 5:1:


2 Cor. 3:17  And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
2 Cor. 4:5  For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake.
Gal. 2:4  And [this,] because of the false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery.
Gal. 5:1  [It is] for freedom [that] Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again.

1. This freeing includes full satisfaction, with a rich, supporting supply and the full enjoyment of Christ-John 4:14b.


John 4:14  But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.

2. This freeing includes the enjoyment of true rest, without being under the heavy burden to keep the law-Matt. 11:28-30.


Matt. 11:28  Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.
Matt. 11:29  Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
Matt. 11:30  For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.

H. The transforming Spirit dispenses the divine life, nature, essence, element-even the Divine Being into us so that we may be metabolically changed in our inner being-2 Cor. 3:18:


2 Cor. 3:18  But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.

1. When we turn our heart to the Lord to behold and reflect the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done.



2. Thus, we are being transformed metabolically from one degree of glory to another degree of glory to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence.



I. The transmitting Spirit transmits all that Christ is with all the riches of God into us for our participation-13:14:


2 Cor. 13:14  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

1. God is love, and this love is being transmitted as grace into us by the Spirit, who is the Transmitter.



2. The Spirit is the fellowship, the communication, the circula- tion, the transmission of the grace of Christ with the love of the Father, transmitting the divine riches into our being for our enjoyment.
